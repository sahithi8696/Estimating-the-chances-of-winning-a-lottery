# Estimating-the-chances-of-winning-a-lottery

In this project, we contribute to the development of a mobile app that is meant to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning.

We create the logical core of the app and calculate the probabilities. For the first version of the app, we focus on 6/49 lottery game of Canada and build functions that enable users to answer probability questions like:

- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we -play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?

## Data

For the purpose of this project, we consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The data set has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018.
